Stackdriver Trace API uses [Google API extensions][google-gax] to provide an
easy-to-use client library for the [Stackdriver Trace API][] (v1) defined in the [googleapis][] git repository


[googleapis]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/devtools/cloudtrace/v1
[google-gax]: https://github.com/googleapis/gax-ruby

Getting started
---------------

google-cloud-trace will allow you to connect to the [Stackdriver Trace API][] and access all its methods.

In order to achieve so, you need to set up authentication, as well as install the library locally.


Setup Authentication
--------------------

To authenticate all of your API calls, first install and setup the [Google Cloud SDK][].
Once done, you can then run the following command in your terminal:

    $ gcloud beta auth application-default login

or

    $ gcloud auth login

Please see the [gcloud beta auth application-default login][] to find documentation showing the difference between these commands.
